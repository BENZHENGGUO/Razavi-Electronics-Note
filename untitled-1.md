# Chapter 2 - Doping

### Intro

* **Charge carriers come from "electrons and holes（电子与空穴）"**

  holes' movement is slower than electrons', because movement of holes is based on release and trap mechanisms. 

density of holes \(p\) = density of electrons \(n\)= $$n_i$$ **In summary**, $$p = n = n_i$$ $$p*n = n_i^2$$

* **Doping （掺杂）can help us modify the density of charge carriers**

**intrinsic Si** $$\rightarrow$$ **extrinsic Si \(pure Si\)**

**In this case**, the phosphorus atom is called **donor** \(_Because it donates an electron to the current conduction_\)

$$N_d$$ = density of **P** atoms $$\approx$$ $$10^{15}$$~ $$10^{17}$$ $$cm^3$$ \($$N_d$$ : "d" means donor\)

**In the end**, density of free electrons in silicon\(**n**\) $$\approx$$ density of **P** atoms $$\approx$$ $$N_d$$

Also, $$n \cdot p = n_i^2$$

1. n-type \(**Phosphorus** -- 磷\) and p-type \(**Boron** -- 硼\) simiconductors
2. Modified carrier densities
3. Movement of charge \(Carrier Transport\)
4. Drift
5. Diffusion

### Two types of doping

> $n$ : density of free electrons $p$ : density of holes $n\_i$ : density of "free electrons" or holes before doping \(_increase when temperature goes up_\)

* For pure Si : $$n = p = n_i$$ ; $$n \cdot p = n_i^2$$
* For doped Si : $$n \cdot p = n_i^2$$

#### Example 1 ---- n-type Si

If we add $$N_d$$ donor atoms, then the density of free electrons = $$N_d/cm^3$$

* For n-type Si : $$n \approx N_d$$ ; $$p \approx {n_i^2 \over N_d}$$

**Result** : $$n$$ goes up, while $$p$$ goes down.

**Reason** : An abundance of free electrons are provided by **donor atoms** and many of these electrons go and fill up those holes.

_The density of holes_ $$p$$ _become very small._

So, in n-type simiconductors, we call free electrons \($$n$$\) the majority carrier and holes \($$p$$\) the minority carrier.

#### Example 2 ---- p-type Si\( Apply Dual laws 对偶法则 \)

> Q : Can holes becomes majority carriers ?

Add **Boron** into the a silicon crystal, then it becomes a p-type simiconductor.

If we add $$N_a$$ boron atoms per $$cm^3$$ into silicon crystal \( $$_a$$ means accepter \): $$\Longrightarrow$$

1. $$N_a$$ holes per $$cm^3$$
2. p $$\approx N_a$$
3. n $$\cdot$$ p = $$n_i^2 \Rightarrow$$ n $$\approx {n_i^2 \over N_a} $$

_P.S._ 结果显而易见，在硅晶体中掺杂硼原子，硅中空穴数量增加，自由电子数量减少，构成 **p型硅**

# Chapter 1 - Charge Carrier

在半导体物理的学习过程中，搞清楚半导体内部的原子结构是很重要的，它有助于让我们更好的理解半导体器件在电路中是如何工作的。

### Intro

* Where do charge carriers come from?
* What type of charge carriers do we have?
* How can we modify the density of charge carriers?
* How do charge carriers move? 

  \( **We will solve these two questions in the next lecture**\)

### Definition

* **Charge carriers come from "electrons and holes（电子与空穴）"**

  holes' movement is slower than electrons', because movement of holes is based on release and trap mechanisms. 

Density of Holes \(p\) = Density of Electrons \(n\)= $$n_i$$ 

**In summary**, $$p = n = n_i$$ $$p*n = n_i^2$$
